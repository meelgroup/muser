MUSer2 API (c) Anton Belov, 2012-14

At the moment the library provides only a very basic interface; please feel free 
to extend.

Basic instructions
-------------------

Compile with 'make apilib' (for options to make see the main README) -- this 
will create a static library libmuser2_api.a.

If you find that the library is too bulky for your taste, remove some of the
SAT solvers compiled in. This can be done by going into src/wraps directory, 
and modifying its Makefile, as well as hiding the unnecessary wrappers sources
prior to rebuiling wraps. Once this is done, rebuild the API library.

The library can now be linked into any application (-lmuser2_api).

The interface to the library is declared in two headers (which should be 
distributed together with the library): muser2_api.h and muser2_api.hh. 
The former defines C-interface, the latter C++.

Roughly, the application will do something along these lines:

#include "muser2_api.hh"

....

MUSer2 m;

m.init_all();

MUSer2::Gid g1 = m.add_clause(...)
MUSer2::Gid g2 = m.add_clause(...)

m.init_run();
m.compute_mus();
m.reset_run();

const std::vector<Gid>& mus = m.gmus_gids();

m.reset_all();

...

The documentation and examples will be created at some point, meanwhile email
