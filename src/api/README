### README

This directory is for various APIs for our tools.

An API will typically consist of a single header file together with a library --
these can be distributed to end users so that they can properly integrate our tools 
into theirs (i.e. without shell scripts). As such the headers should be clean, and
independent of other BOLT headers (since those do change on regular basis, and often
contain a lot of implementation details). All the BOLT-specific details can be 
hidden into the "implementation" class, which defined in the library, and just
forward-declared in the user-accessible header. See muser2_api for an example.
